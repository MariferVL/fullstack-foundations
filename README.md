# Fullstack Foundations

**A curated collection of microprojects to revisit and reinforce core fullstack concepts — with real-world context.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed as a personal learning base and a public resource for anyone starting their journey in fullstack development. Each project focuses on a specific HTML, CSS, or JavaScript concept, implemented through small, standalone exercises inspired by fintech scenarios — making the learning process both practical and relevant.

Whether you're reviewing fundamentals, onboarding new developers, or mentoring beginners, this repo offers a structured and contextualized way to explore the building blocks of the web.

## 🧱 Structure

Projects are organized into folders by topic and technology:

- **HTML-only projects**: Pure markup exercises to understand structure, semantics, and form elements.
- **CSS-enhanced projects**: Styling fundamentals including box model, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript-powered projects**: Interactive behaviors, DOM manipulation, and basic logic.

Each folder contains:
- `index.html` — the main file for the exercise
- Optional `style.css` or `script.js` depending on the stage
- A fintech-inspired use case
- A "Try it" section (coming soon) for live experimentation, similar to MDN's interactive playgrounds
